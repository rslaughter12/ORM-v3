Module 14 MVC Homework: TECH BLOG

Repository https://github.com/rslaughter12/ORM-v3

The repository for this project can be found using the link above. 

Description This module consisted of creating a functioning tech blog. The upon loading the site the user is met with a sign in and sign up box. If the user is not signed in they can not view or post. Once the user is signed in they can create posts and read other's posts. The user can also sign out.


Future Development
I would like to in the future add where the databases are communicating together where it will show who posted what and when in the card as well. 
Another thing would be to make it only allow you to delete your own posts. Right now any person can delete any post.
Finally a goal of this activity was to deploy to heroku. I was unable to do this. I would like to figure out how to do this in the future. It says on Heroku that it is running and deployed however the site gives an application error.
